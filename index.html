      <h1>Welcome, My name is Cristian</h1>
      <p>This is my retro-styled developer portfolio. Inspired by the early days of programming with GW-BASIC, Pascal, and FoxPro.</p>

      <!-- Projects Overview Section -->
      <div class="section-content">
        <!-- LiveCode: link on H2 -->
        <h2><a href="livecode.html">LiveCode</a></h2>
        <p>LiveCode is a cross-platform rapid-application environment inspired by HyperCard, using an English-like xTalk scripting language. It offers a compile-free workflow so the same code runs across desktop, mobile and the web, speeding prototyping and release. Its readable, expressive syntax emphasizes maintainability and productivity.</p>

        <!-- VB.NET -->
        <h2><a href="under-construction.html">VB.NET</a></h2>
        <p>VB.NET is a modern, object-oriented dialect of Visual Basic that runs on the .NET platform. It uses a readable, English-like syntax and integrates tightly with the .NET libraries, making desktop, web, and service development straightforward. With strong typing, async/await, LINQ, and first-class tooling in Visual Studio, VB.NET balances approachability with production-grade power.</p>


        <!-- Visual Basic Classic -->
        <h2><a href="under-construction.html">Visual Basic Classic</a></h2>
        <p>Visual Basic 1.0–6.0 (“classic VB”) made Windows application building delightfully fast. With a drag-and-drop form designer, event-driven code, and rich controls, it turned ideas into running EXEs in hours, not weeks. Its readable Basic syntax, COM/ActiveX component model, and database wizards powered countless business apps. VB6 crowned the era, balancing simplicity with serious capability that still inspires tools today.</p>


        <!-- Legacy / Early Projects -->
        <h2>Legacy / Early Projects</h2>
        <p>These legacy projects celebrate the roots of home computing: GW-BASIC line-numbered programs that PEEK/POKE memory and make the PC speaker sing; Turbo Pascal’s lightning-fast compiler and tidy Borland IDE; FoxPro’s xBase databases with blistering indexes and quick forms; and straight Assembly, where interrupts and addresses were your API. Built on 8086/286/386 machines, CRTs, and floppy disks, they honor constraints—kilobytes not gigabytes, 16-bit segments, and code that had to start instantly and never crash. Here you’ll find small utilities, experiments, and tiny games that squeezed surprising behavior from modest hardware. It’s a tribute to the tools and tinkerers that taught clarity, efficiency, and craftsmanship—and a reminder that today’s stacks stand on the shoulders of those humming, green-glow machines.</p>
        <p>My early coding projects including QBasic, Turbo Pascal, and FoxPro programs from DOS-era experiments and learning days.</p>
